An example cxould be the one that is shown in the Lecture 4 in Part 1. Where we can see an encoding of 5 elements: A, B, C, D & E in a pie chart. While that won't give any intuitive or easily understanding of the amount of each variable, if we transform that angle encoding (piechart) into a lenth encoding (bar chart) we can clearly distinguish the amounts of each variable. Another encoding, itÂ´s a network encoding, which will give us a really good understanding about realtion between elements. "
